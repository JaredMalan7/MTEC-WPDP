    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I love working with cars and Motorcycles. I strongly believe that classics are &gt; than modern cars. What can I say, I like classic!
        <br>I also love love Cheeseburgers. Cheeseburgers are &gt; any food, but they are &lt; a double Cheeseburgers and &lt; the triple patty ones.  
        <br>I also love programming! I even own a T-shirt that says &lt;I love code&gt;
    </p>
    <h3>I love programming so much here is an example of some HTML code.</h3>
